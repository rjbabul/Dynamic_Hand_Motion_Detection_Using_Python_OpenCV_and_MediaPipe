# Dynamic_Hand_Motion_Detection_Using_Python_OpenCV_and_MediaPipe
Hand gesture recognition using Python Opecv and mediapipe 
is a project based on Human Computer Interaction in Computer Vision that is subset of Machine learning.
In this project I have developed 8 different functions of 
Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition such as. 

1. Detect Right Hand.

2. Detect Left Hand.

3. Move Right ( Move the left hand from the left side to the right of the body).

4. Move Left( Move the right hand from the right side to the left of the body).

5. Move both hand ( Move left and Move right).

6. Move Up (Move The right hand from the bottom to the top).

7. Detect Right hand and Move Right.

8. Detect Left hand and Move Left.
